# SMHI_temp_plotter

Plots the temperature at 15:00 in SÃ¶derhamn during a certain time interval using data from a SMHI csv file from https://www.smhi.se/data/meteorologi/ladda-ner-meteorologiska-observationer/#param=airtemperatureInstant,stations=all. Note that the time intervals in the file are from 1949 to 1997 and from 2001 to 2012. 

The file uses both swedish and english variable names and input prompts. It will be rewritten more cleanly in the future, but works for now.
